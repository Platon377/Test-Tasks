How to run? (in VS)
- open the source file in Visual Studio
- run, using appropriate button
- add csv filenames on toolbar Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Command Arguments 

How to run? (in terminal)
- to compile, use the command 
```bash 
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 task3.cpp -o task3
```
- to run, use the command:
```bash
./task3 <fileName1.csv> <fileName2.csv>
```

How it works?
- the data is read from 2 csv file with ";" as a delimeter; the columns should be arranged in form user_id,  product_id, timestamp
- the unordered map is used to store the data, where ther user_id is the key and its associated value is a set of the visited pages
- firstly we iterate through the users of the second day (O(n)) and check whether they're present among the users of the first day (since unsorted_map is a hashtable internally, this check is done in expected O(1))
- then we check whether the set difference of the pages visted on both days is empty set, if not, then on the second day user visited the page that hadnâ€™t been visited by this user on the first day
- this check was impemented as the seperate function and benefits heavily from the fact that unordered_set inside is also a hash table, providing .find() method with expected O(1) time
- reading data from the file in this case is dominatin in O, so the general time complexity is O(m + n), where m and n is the #users on first and second days respectively (more detailed in code in form of comments)

Note:
- example csv files are also provided
